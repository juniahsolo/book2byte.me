            <p>
              Book2Byte was born from a conversation about privilege and
              potential. Our founder, a lifelong reader and technologist, saw a
              stark divide: children in some communities were surrounded by
              books and devices, while others grew up without ever holding a
              storybook. This wasn't just an absence of entertainment; it was an
              absence of opportunityâ€”the chance to explore, to imagine, and to
              see the world beyond their immediate surroundings.
            </p>
            <p>
              The mission began with a single focus: get storybooks into the
              hands of children in marginalized areas. We believe that literacy
              is the foundation upon which all other learning is built. A child
              who loves to read is a child who is empowered to learn anything.

                  providing children in underserved communities with access to
                  engaging storybooks and literacy programs. We aim to cultivate

                  To bridge the digital divide by recycling technology and
                  creating access to digital tools and education. We envision a

                  information, but to create, innovate, and participate in the
                  digital world.
